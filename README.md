### **NETFLIX & CHILL**
#### The date night solution.

##### PROBLEM/SOLUTION
* You: "Babe, what do you wanna do tonight?"
* Significant Other: "I dunno, babe, what do you wanna do? 
* You: "I dunno, I asked you." 
* S/O: "Yeah, but I don't have any ideas babe, so you tell me." 

Does this sound like a familiar back-and-forth between you and your significant other? Let Netflix & Chill help you out. Tell us some of the ingredients you have in your fridge and what genre of movie you're in the mood for, and we will take care of the rest. What you do during the movie... well, we'll leave that up to you.
